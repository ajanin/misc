# Got "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is 'docker -d' running on this host?"
# Rebooted. Still got. Google suggest:
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
# Log in, log out
docker run -it --rm ubuntu bash
# Downloaded ubuntu, but then got "write pipe: bad file descriptor"
# Turns out docker doesn't track architecture (or anything else). Must use an image with compatible arch.
docker run -it --rm armv7/armhf-ubuntu bash
# Works!

# Currently at:
ssh odroid@10.21.105.117
# Changed the password - ask if you wanna try to log in!
