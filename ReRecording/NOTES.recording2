Recording on Sept 21, 2016

Setup is almost the same as the first recording, except it was done in
6a at ICSI (same as the ICSI Meeting Corpus). The two speakers were at
the extreme ends of the table. The iphone, biamp, and polycom were in
the center; the Samsung s4 was near the speaker closer to the door;
the Samsung s3 was near the speaker near the screen.
